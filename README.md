# Classification-Case-Study-DNN
Case Study of Classification problem using Deep Neural Networks

The case, is another implementation of classical dataset case, about whether approve or not approve bank loans to clients. The whole dataset attributes as well as the whole code is commented in the code script.

It shoud be compared with the case ran on the previous repository (Classification-Case-Study) where classical Machine Learning algoritms was used. The performance was very similar. We can conclude, we might now try to change some parameters or select different attributes in order to try to improve performance, instead trying different methods.
